2020/03/09 10:33:45 AM GMT+1,4,5,2,1,5,anonymised,it was very straightforward and not too difficult to use,acceptable,accept,"i checked the detailed information to find out why the food wasn't suitable for consumption, this isn't available at the moment so we don't know how long food has been in the open or if there has been an issue with the fridge it is kept in",5,that food should always be kept within strict temperatures,i would - especially in FH we are that bit further away from OA so we really don't know how long food has been left out prior to it getting here.,yes i think it would - it would make me more aware of how long we should have food out of fridges etc.,i hope they would be more conscientious of how long food is out of fridge and temperature control,90%,4,only if it hasn't been out of the fridge too long if it has been at room temperature for more than 1/2 hour or so i would be dubious about accepting it,very informative
2020/03/09 10:36:06 AM GMT+1,5,5,2,1,5,anonymised,"Very easy to use, glad that I don't have to download a new app but instead just tap my phone. Maybe the user framework could be a bit ... 'prettier', as right now it looks quite technical, but it functions perfectly fine",not-acceptable,accept,"Yes, I looked at the stages and accepted the delivery despite it not meeting the temperature guidelines as it was only one degree above the fridge temperature",5,"That chilled food can be outside for up to 4 hours, having worked in retail our guidelines were 30 minutes maximum or the chilled food had to be binned so I would've never known it can be that long","Yes, also to know how long we have before the food should be consumed","It would make me question the safety a bit more, currently I don't even think about it and just accept whatever Catering brings",Positive public perception,Fully,4,"As I saw in my trial case, the temperature was above the maximum but only by one degree which I wasn't too concerned about.","As you explained, the finished product will be more polished, so that will definitely increase the attractiveness of such device"
2020/03/09 10:54:10 AM GMT+1,5,5,1,1,5,anonymised,"The App was very simple to use, one tap and you are started. The information it provides is easy to understand and guides you with red and green alerts.",acceptable,accept,"Yes, it explained how long it had been out of the fridge/ in the fridge the temperature of the fridge too and if this was acceptable or not.  By doing this I could see if it had been out of the fridge or in the incorrect temperature for any length of time which is invaluable.",5,"I did, I learned about suitable temperatures, putting food in and out of different fridges.","Absolutely, during events the delivery can not always be at the time you want it so it may be that it has to sit out of a fridge for some time so this would give peace of mind.",Because it gives you information and an awareness that I did not already have.,This would have positive impact as it would make them more aware of guidelines and avoid errors in the future.,I would trust it 100% as it gives exact details.,5,"no, if the app says it isn't acceptable I would not accept it.",I think this is a fantastic idea - for an organisations that have such a lot of catering requirements/deliveries this is invaluable as it avoids the risks of food being held in an incorrect manner.  Fantastic!
2020/03/09 11:03:14 AM GMT+1,5,5,1,1,4,anonymised,Very straightforward and easy to use.,not-acceptable,accept,"The main message said it was not acceptable because it had been out of the fridge twice.  However when I looked at the additional data, the temperature had always been fine so I was happy to accept.",5,I didn't learn anything new (but my background is in Catering) but it was good to be reminded of these things. ,"Yes, it made me realise that we don't know what happens with our food before it arrives so I feel it would be useful in the future. ",No but again my background is in catering so I am quite careful about how long I have food out etc. ,I think it could have many positive impacts on a company as it would show they are adhering to Food Safety Laws.  The only time it would have a negative impact is if they not putting in place Good Practices.,I would trust it a lot. ,5,It could say it was not acceptable because it had been out of the fridge but the temps in the room are colder than the fridge which would mean it would be acceptable to take the food. ,I think it has great potential and look forward to seeing what can be done with it.
2020/03/09 11:31:19 AM GMT+1,4,2,1,1,4,anonymised,It was an easy to use app. It didn't require any previous knowledge. ,not-acceptable,accept,"I did read the stages and the detailed information provided. For instance, I read that during the fridge stage the food was not under the limit (5 degrees), but it was for an hour in 6 degrees. The app told me to not accept because of that, but I considered that it was not an issue. Besides, the aesthetic of the sandwiches was convincing enough as to overlook the recommendation of the app. ",4,That the food goes through several stages before being delivered.,"Yes, because I would be sure that the food is not a risk for my health. Nevertheless, I wonder if I would decline a delivery in situations where I am very hungry or have been waiting a long time to get the order. ",It would be a challenge for the providers.,"I think many small companies would not be able to afford double delivery in case their orders are declined. Furthermore, this app could generate extra wasted food in cases where the customers are extremely picky. ",It seems very reliable.,3,"As I indicated, if I am too hungry, if I have waited too much for the order and would not want to wait for another delivery, or if the order looks aesthetically ok. ","I don't know if you are considering the some food are seen as more dangerous than others. For instance, if the order is only seafood, no matter what, if the app tells me that it is not acceptable I would do what the app tells. "
2020/03/09 11:47:34 AM GMT+1,5,5,1,1,5,anonymised,Very easy to use,acceptable,accept,yes - making sure the standards were no compromised at any stage during delivery.,5,Yes - many standards for all stages of delivery required.,absolutely yes,Yes - more confident of how it got to the venue.,I think positive as later events may feel food is made early morning and sitting about for a time.,absolutely - no complex calculations just temp readings.,5,No - if I am using this app then trusting it's verdict is key to hygene.,"I think this is a very valuable addition to food safety - especially when so much food poisoning happens.

2020/03/09 1:21:18 PM GMT+1,4,3,1,1,4,anonymised,Don't quite understand this question as i didn't use the app to receive the delivery ,not-acceptable,decline,"Yes, fir further information to help me make a decision ",3,Not really ,Could be useful ,Perhaps make me more aware,"Yes, may result in deliveries being rejected, companies being out of pocket ",Would trust the date,4,If it said it had been out of the fridge too long but it was food where that didn't matter ,None
2020/03/09 6:08:24 PM GMT+1,5,5,1,1,5,anonymised,It was easy to use and understand,acceptable,accept,Yes looked at all the data to identify whether the sandwiches were kept at the correct temperature through the delivery process,5,"yes it was useful to identify the sandwiches were kept at the correct temperature, and it identified the different senarios with delivery, and whether is was acceptable to receive or decline the order",Yes I would use this service  especially with meat or fish fillings to ensure these were kept at the correct temperatures and were safe to eat,Yes it is more likely to make me more aware of the delivery process and food safety,I think it would have a positive impact as there is reassurance of food safety,100%,5,I would base it on the type of food and the temperatures identified and then make a judgement,It was interesting to take part as it did make me realise how you could receive food which could be at risk
2020/03/10 3:19:23 PM GMT+1,5,4,1,2,4,anonymised,"It was really seamless and the information was helpful to decide whether the food was safe to eat. In the demonstration I was only shown the app when the delivery arrived with the researcher, I think it would be useful to know when the delivery is in action in real time too especially for organising events when we would be waiting on catering breaks etc. ",acceptable,accept,"Yes, to see how long at each stage the food had been in and out of the fridge to see if it would be safe to eat, as appearances did not indicate that it looks good or not. ",5,How long food should be out of the fridge or at certain temperatures for safe consumption,"Yes, it would be useful. A lot of our use of catering deliveries is for drop in lunches, so food would be laid out for a while. This service would be useful so we can know how long the food has been acceptable before arrival to then impact how long we should make the food available to delegates. ",Positive changes to ensure food is safer to eat,Could be negative if readings are inaccurate or altered as the company would then potentially have to waste acceptable food if it was rejected,Likely trust the data especially timings data ,4,"If there was a very cold day and the food had been outside for longer than it should, therefore unacceptable, but the room temperature etc was cooler then potentially accept. Would be likely to accept food less likely to provoke food poisoning ie vegetable filling sandwiches. ",It was useful and a technology we would be interested in using.
